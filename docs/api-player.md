# Player API Reference
Players are simplified/specialized Pipelines, created with a single [Source](/docs/api-source.md) and single [Sink](/docs/api-sink.md). Once created, the Source and Sink attributes can be updated, however, the components cannot be removed or replaced.

#### Player Construction and Destruction
There are three types of Players that can be created. 
* The **Basic Player**, created with any one Source and Sink by calling [`dsl_player_new`](#dsl_player_new). The Source and Sink components must exists at the time of Player construction
* Two Render Players that create and manage their own Sink and Source Components
  * An **Image Render Player**, created by calling  [`dsl_player_render_image_new`](#dsl_player_render_image_new), that creates an Image Source and Render Sink; Overlay or Window as specified.
  * A **Video Render Player**, created by calling  [`dsl_player_render_video_new`](#dsl_player_render_video_new), that creates a Video File Source and Render Sink as specified.

Players are destructed by calling [`dsl_player_delete`](#dsl_player_delete) or [`dsl_player_delete_all`](#dsl_player_delete_all).

#### Adding an Image Render Player to an ODE Capture Action
Images Players can be added to either a Frame or Object Capture Action for auto-play on ODE occurrence by calling [`dsl_ode_action_capture_image_player_add`](/docs/api-ode-action.md#dsl_ode_action_capture_image_player_add) and removed by calling [`dsl_ode_action_capture_image_player_remove`](/docs/api-ode-action.md#dsl_ode_action_capture_image_player_remove)

#### Adding a Video Render Player to a Smart Recording Tap or Sink
Video Players can be added to Smart Recording Taps and Sinks for auto-play on recording complete by calling [`dsl_tap_record_video_player_add`](/docs/api-tap.md#dsl_tap_record_video_player_add) and `[dsl_sink_record_video_player_add`](/docs/api-sink.md#dsl_sink_record_video_player_add) respectively and removed by calling [`dsl_tap_record_video_player_remove`](/docs/api-tap.md#dsl_tap_record_video_player_remove) and [`dsl_sink_record_video_player_remove`](/docs/api-sink.md#dsl_sink_record_video_player_remove)

#### Playing, Pausing and Stopping Players
Players can be played by calling [`dsl_player_play`](#dsl_player_play), paused (non-live sources only) by calling [`dsl_player_pause`](#dsl_player_pause), and stopped by calling [`dsl_player_stop`](#dsl_player_stop).

#### Player Client-Listener Notifications
Clients can be notified of **Player Termination** on **End-of-Stream** events by registering/deregistering one or more callback functions with [`dsl_player_termination_event_listener_add`](#dsl_player_termination_event_listener_add) / [`dsl_player_termination_event_listener_remove`](#dsl_player_termination_event_listener_remove).
